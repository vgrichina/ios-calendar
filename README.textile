h2. Introduction

ios-calendar is a stylable month calendar view for use in iPhone applications.

It has two branches:
* @master@ allows you customize it without using Three20.
* @three20@ uses "Three20 framework":http://three20.info for styling

While there are existing implementations ("Kal":https://github.com/klazuka/Kal and @TKCalendarMonthView@ from "Tapku Library":https://github.com/devinross/tapkulibrary, they are quite limited. In particular they both replicate styling and functionality of iPhone Calendar app and there is basically no easy way to adjust them. In addition to this â€“ only portrait view is supported in them.

ios-calenar was developed to solve aforementioned problems. It's default design is heavily inspired by "MoMa iPhone app":http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moma/id383990455?mt=8.

h2. Project setup

For @master@ branch:
You can use project as dependency or just drop source code into your project.
Important: Calendar don't uses ARC.

For @three20@ branch:
While not elegant at all, currently the best method to add ios-calendar to your project is just to drop its source code in it (from "Calendar" group).
It is possible to use it as dependency, but only when your project doesn't itself use Three20. Otherwise build results in XCode crash. I'm looking for suggestions on how better to resolve this issue.

h2. Usage sample

XCode project on GitHub contains sample target - CalendarDemo.

h3. CalendarDemoViewController.m

<pre><code>#import "CalendarDemoViewController.h"

@implementation CalendarDemoViewController

- (void) loadView {
    [super loadView];

    self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];

    CXCalendarView *calendarView = [[[CXCalendarView alloc] initWithFrame: self.view.bounds] autorelease];
    calendarView.frame = self.view.bounds;
    calendarView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;
    calendarView.selectedDate = [NSDate date];
    calendarView.delegate = self;

    [self.view addSubview: calendarView];
}

- (BOOL) shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: (UIInterfaceOrientation) interfaceOrientation {
    return YES;
}

#pragma mark CXCalendarViewDelegate

- (void) calendarView: (CXCalendarView *) calendarView
        didSelectDate: (NSDate *) date {
    NSLog(@"Selected date: %@", date);
}

- (void)  calendarView: (CXCalendarView *) calendarView
didChangeDisplayedDate: (NSDate *) displayedDate {
    NSDateComponents *components = [calendarView.calendar components: NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit
                                                            fromDate: displayedDate];
    NSLog(@"Displayed date: %d.%d", components.month, components.year);
}
